# pythonUtils

!Needs Python 3 to work. The string representation doesn't work in python2

This repository contains my personnal python utilities.
Random tools and data structure that I may find useful in future projects and proofs of concept.

At the moment the repository contains :

* ftuple : A module containing the ```ftuple``` class. The module provides methods to use tuples like arrays in an immutable and functionnal style.
